# MVP

## JavaScript Stuff
- Card Numbers and labels need to be updated for drawn cards - move onclick from html to js
- Other types of draw need to work (and add labels to cards)
- User input needs to be allowed to add custom labels
- Move to End needs to be created
-move fleeting to labels, code so that when nextTurn is clicked, it automatically gets deleted
- qol updates (right click is delete a card, etc. we'll think about it)

## CSS Stuff
- Blue background behind cards should be made more appealing 
    (lor board backgrounds, custom design, curved edges, etc.)
- Buttons should be seperated into 2 categories: cardManipulators, labelManipulators
- Buttons should be redesigned to have a similar color palette to blue background redesign
- Turn counter should be updated accordingly to fit in with the redesign
- Toggle buttons should have an effect where the user knows that button is toggled (think button pushed down to indicate that button is on)


# To Do List aftwerwards:
## Mulligan Function:
- Set Number of cards in HTML to 4 cards
- Buttons should be hidden and replaced with Mulligan buttons to begin
- new button that says confirm after user selects which cards were mulliganed
- Buttons / Turn counter should reappear after user selects confirm (the mulligan)
- Turn counter should be set to one and auto-draw a card
- Card labels for the initial 4 cards should indicate which ones were kept / mulliganed
## Animations
- Simple Fade-out for mulligan buttons into the rest of the buttons
- Card drawing / discarding animation? At least slow down the cards moving so it's not instantaneous
## Help Button
- Small Question mark button in the bottom right / left which, when clicked on, opens a pop-up explaining basics of the website
